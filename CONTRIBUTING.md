# Contributing to Toutui

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Version
This project is still in **heavy development**. I built this app to learn Rust. The code isn‚Äôt fully optimized or clear. However, feel free to contact me with any questions. There are known bugs (check [known_bugs](https://github.com/AlbanDAVID/Toutui/blob/main/known_bugs.md) and open issues).
